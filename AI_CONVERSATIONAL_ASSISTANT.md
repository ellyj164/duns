# Conversational Financial AI Assistant

## How It Works

This AI assistant behaves like a human financial assistant. It:

1. **Understands natural language** - Ask questions like you would to a real person
2. **Queries the database** - Converts your question to SQL automatically
3. **Responds naturally** - Gives you answers in conversational language

## Example Conversations

**Q:** "Who is the latest person paid?"
**A:** "The latest person who was paid is John Doe."

**Q:** "How much did we spend last month?"
**A:** "We spent a total of 4,200,000 RWF last month."

**Q:** "List top 3 clients"
**A:** "Here are the top 3 clients by payments: John Doe, Mary K., and Felix R."

## Technical Details

- **Model**: tinyllama (optimized for fast response times)
- **Architecture**: Two-stage AI processing
  - Stage 1: Convert question → SQL
  - Stage 2: Convert SQL results → Natural language
- **Security**: Only SELECT queries allowed, all modifications blocked

## Setup

1. Ensure Ollama is running:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

2. Pull the model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull tinyllama
   ```

3. Access the chat from your dashboard (logged-in users only)

## Model Configuration

Default: `tinyllama` (fast response times)
Alternative: `qwen2.5:7b-instruct` (for high-end systems)
Alternative: `llama3.1:8b-instruct` (for high-end systems)

```
